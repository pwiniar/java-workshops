search value - any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different characters ex:abba

valid - abba[mnop]qrst looking value before brackets
valid - ioxxoj[asdfgh]zxcvbn looking value is outside square brackets, even though it's within a larger string
invalid - abcd[bddb]xyyx looking value is within square brackets, even though xyyx is outside square brackets
invalid - aaaa[qwer]tyui looking value is invalid

SSL
valid aba[bab]xyz supports SSL (aba outside square brackets with corresponding bab within square brackets).
valid zazbz[bzb]cdb supports SSL (zaz has no corresponding aza, but zbz has a corresponding bzb,
    even though zaz and zbz overlap).
valid aaa[kek]eke supports SSL (eke in supernet with corresponding kek in hypernet;
    the aaa sequence is not related, because the interior character must be different).
invalid xyx[xyx]xyx does not support SSL (xyx, but no corresponding yxy).
